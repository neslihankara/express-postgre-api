This is my solution to a challenge to build an api using Node.js, Express.js, PostreSQL + Sequelize ORM, JWT, Nodemailer and Docker.

# Installation

In the directory you would like to have the project, clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:neslihankara/express-postgre-api.git
```

Open the project in your coding environment.

# Providing the environment variables

Please fill out your .env file according to the sample I provided under `docs` folder

# Install the dependencies

```
$ docker-compose up --build
```

# Run the stack

```
$ docker-compose up
```

# Access the stack from an API client

localhost:8080

# Using the Postman Collection File

Please see the `express-postgres-api.postman_collection.json` under `docs` folder.
To open up this collection on Postman, navigate to Postman > File > Import > Find and choose this file.

You can now find the requests ready under your workspace.
